MissingOutputException in rule qc_report  in line 50 of /home/ars/nsu/bioinformatics/snakemake-files/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../SRR12717711_qc_report.txt completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
